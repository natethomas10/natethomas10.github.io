      <description>With no NCAA Tournament in 2020, there was really no way to compare conferences against each other for the consolation prize of “Best Conference in the Country”. For example, in 2021, everyone crowned the Big Ten as the best conference in the regular season. That was before a lackluster Tournament performance led people to believe that maybe they were not the best.
So today, I will be using data to formulate which conference was the best during the 2019-20 season.</description>
