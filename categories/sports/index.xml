      <description>The 2020-21 season has been remembered so far for playing through the pandemic, the highly competitive MVP race and the injuries to the best players around the league. But one thing that has stuck out to me this year, is the offensive production by teams and individual players all season.
I first heard about how ridiculous the offense was in the first few weeks of the season listening to a few different NBA podcasts.</description>

      <description>With no NCAA Tournament in 2020, there was really no way to compare conferences against each other for the consolation prize of “Best Conference in the Country”. For example, in 2021, everyone crowned the Big Ten as the best conference in the regular season. That was before a lackluster Tournament performance led people to believe that maybe they were not the best.
So today, I will be using data to formulate which conference was the best during the 2019-20 season.</description>
